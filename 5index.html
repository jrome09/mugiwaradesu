   <h3>Oda's One piece</h3>     
   <div id="oda">  <img src="C:\Users\TOSHIBA\Desktop\website\images\Oda.jpg"200px" width="200px">  <p> Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 104 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirate The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by Production I.G, and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials.

<h3>Oda's award</h3>
<p><img src="C:\Users\TOSHIBA\Desktop\website\images\award.jfif">One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.

As of August 2022, One Piece had over 516.5 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume. It is also one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time</p>

<h3>Oda's inspirations</h3>
<p>One of Oda's biggest inspirations for One Piece was DBZ, without that the One Piece of today most likely wouldn't exist. You can see DBZ's influence not only in the art style, which was Oda's main inspiration, but also in some of the arcs, character personalities, and relationships as well. Now here I will only be addressing the arc influences due to the fact that that is the most important of the points I named above, and if I went through all the others it would unnecessarily extend this post. If you are however interested in me doing a more thorough breakdown then let me know and I'll work on it.</p>
